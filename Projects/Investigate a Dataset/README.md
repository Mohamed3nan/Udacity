# Investigate a Dataset
## Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, I will us Python plus the following libraries:
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv

## Why this Project?
In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of my analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access my data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
